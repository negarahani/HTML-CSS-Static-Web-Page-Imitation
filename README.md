# HTML-CSS-Static-Web-Page-Imitation
This project involves replicating a given web page using HTML and CSS technologies. The objective is to closely imitate the provided design without relying on any additional tools beyond a text editor. The assignment includes creating a webpage with active links that direct users to different sections of the same page. Each section corresponds to a link labeled "Home," "Services," "About," "Gallery," and "Contact." Additionally, the page should dynamically scroll to the relevant section upon clicking a link.

To complete the task, four images (image1.png, image2.png, image3.png, and flower.png) are required. The project emphasizes the use of CSS for styling and positioning elements accurately. The provided video and screenshots aid in visualizing the desired outcome.

Testing the webpage on Firefox is recommended, particularly by resizing the browser window to match the dimensions of the top PNG image (image1.png) to ensure correct font, color, size, and text positioning.
